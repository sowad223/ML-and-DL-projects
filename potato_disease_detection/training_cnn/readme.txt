Potato Disease Detection
This repository is dedicated to developing and experimenting with various machine learning models for detecting diseases in potato plants based on image data. The project aims to accurately classify different types of potato diseases, ultimately helping farmers and agricultural professionals make informed decisions.

Project Overview
Potato crops are susceptible to a variety of diseases that can severely affect yield and quality. Early detection and accurate identification of these diseases are crucial for effective management and control. In this project, we aim to build a robust image classification system that can identify different potato diseases using machine learning models.

Models Implemented
1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Architecture:

Input Layer: Preprocessing steps include resizing and rescaling the images to ensure they are compatible with the model's input requirements.
Convolutional Layers: Three convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions are used to extract features from the input images. Each convolutional layer is followed by a max-pooling layer to reduce spatial dimensions.
Dense Layers: The flattened output from the convolutional layers is fed into a dense layer with ReLU activation to learn complex patterns.
Output Layer: A softmax layer is used to classify the images into one of the predefined disease categories.
Training:

The model was trained using an image dataset of potato leaves, labeled with the respective disease categories.
The training process involved splitting the data into training and validation sets to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
Results:

The CNN model achieved an accuracy of X% on the validation set after Y epochs.
The model is capable of classifying diseases such as Late Blight, Early Blight, and healthy potato leaves.
Future Work
This project is ongoing, and additional models will be implemented and evaluated, including:

Transfer Learning Models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50)
Other Deep Learning Architectures (e.g., RNN, LSTM)
Traditional Machine Learning Approaches (e.g., SVM, Random Forest)
