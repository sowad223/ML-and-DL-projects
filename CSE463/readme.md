# CSE463 : Computer Vision

This course provides an introduction to computer vision including fundamentals of image
formation, camera imaging geometry, feature detection and matching, stereo, motion estimation
and tracking, image classification and scene understanding. We will explore methods for depth
recovery from stereo images, camera calibration, automated alignment, tracking, boundary
detection, and recognition. We will use both classical machine learning and deep learning to
approach these problems. The focus of the course is to develop the intuitions and mathematics of
the methods in lecture, and then to learn about the difference between theory and practice in the
projects.
