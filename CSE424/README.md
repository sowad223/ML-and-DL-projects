**1. Detection and Monitoring of Maltese Shoreline Changes using Sentinel-2 Imagery**
This paper explores the application of Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for detecting and monitoring shoreline changes along the Maltese coast. The study employs the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to identify shoreline positions and analyzes the results against Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data obtained from LIDAR systems. The methodology involves band extraction, NDWI computation, image thresholding, and shoreline extraction using the QGIS platform. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of Sentinel-2 data in monitoring minimal shoreline displacement, with significant changes observed at specific locations such as Ramla Bay. This research highlights the potential of remote sensing techniques in coastal monitoring and management.

**2. Assessment of the Vulnerability of the Lucana Coastal Zones (South Italy) to Natural Hazards**
This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of the vulnerability of the Lucana coastal zones in South Italy to natural hazards, particularly coastal flooding and erosion. The study introduces two methodologies: the Integrated Vulnerability Index (IVI) and the CeD Physical Vulnerability Index (PVI). The IVI combines indices related to flooding and erosion, incorporating both physical and socio-economic factors, while the CeD method focuses on physical characteristics like beach width and shoreline evolution. The results indicate varying degrees of vulnerability across different coastal segments, with certain areas facing significant risks. The findings provide valuable insights for developing targeted coastal management strategies and highlight the importance of continuous monitoring in the face of climate change.
